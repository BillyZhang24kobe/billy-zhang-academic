Hello! My name is Xuanming (Billy) Zhang, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Columbia University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. {{<staticref "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/">}} Zhou Yu {{< /staticref >}} and Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/chilton.html">}} Lydia Chilton {{< /staticref >}}. I'm happy to be part of the {{<staticref "http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi">}} Columbia NLP Lab {{< /staticref >}} and the {{<staticref "https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/">}} Computational Design Lab {{< /staticref >}}. My reseach interests center around Natural Language Processing, Dialogue Systems and Human-AI Interaction. My goal is to develop practical NLP systems that can be broadly applied to assit human-AI collaboration.

Throughout my research journey, I am fortunately guided by so many awesome researchers and I really appreciate their help: Prof. {{<staticref "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/">}} Kathleen McKeown {{< /staticref >}} at Columbia University, Prof. {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">}} Zhiyuan Liu {{< /staticref >}} in {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">}} THUNLP {{< /staticref >}} at Tsinghua University, Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/">}} Vincent Ng {{< /staticref >}} at University of Texas at Dallas, Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahuldivekar/">}} Rahul Divekar  {{< /staticref >}} at Bentley University, and {{<staticref "https://rutujaubale.github.io/">}} Rutuja Ubale {{< /staticref >}} at {{<staticref "https://www.ets.org/research/ai-labs.html">}} ETS AI Labs {{< /staticref >}}.

<!-- At present, I am a Graduate Research Intern at the {{<staticref "http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi">}} NLP Lab at Columbia {{< /staticref >}}, working closely with Prof. {{<staticref "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/">}} Kathleen McKeown {{< /staticref >}} on emotion analysis, and with Prof. {{<staticref "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/">}} Zhou Yu {{< /staticref >}} on Dialogue Systems. Meanwhile, I also serve as a Collegiate Associate at {{<staticref "https://www.ets.org/research/ai-labs.html">}} ETS AI Labs {{< /staticref >}}, where I work with {{<staticref "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahuldivekar/">}} Rahul Divekar  {{< /staticref >}} and {{<staticref "https://rutujaubale.github.io/">}} Rutuja Ubale  {{< /staticref >}} on spoken languge understanding for English Language Learning. Before joining Columbia and ETS AI Labs, I was a full-time Research Assistant in {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">}} THUNLP {{< /staticref >}} at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">}} Zhiyuan Liu {{< /staticref >}} on NLP applications in Computational Social Science. I also keep close connection with Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/">}} Vincent Ng {{< /staticref >}} at UT Dallas on sentiment analysis. -->
 
I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Aritifical Intelligence from {{<staticref "https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">}} University of Nottingham Ningbo China {{< /staticref >}}, where I completed my first thesis project with Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">}} Zheng Lu {{< /staticref >}}. You can find my thesis {{< staticref "uploads/billyzhang_thesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
