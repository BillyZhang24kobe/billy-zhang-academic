abstract: "Computational Social Science (CSS), aiming at utilizing computational methods to address social
science problems, is a recent emerging and fast-developing field. The study of CSS is data-driven and
significantly benefits from the availability of online user-generated contents and social networks, which contain
rich text and network data for investigation. However, these large-scale and multi-modal data also present
researchers with a great challenge: how to represent data effectively to mine the meanings we want in CSS?
To explore the answer, we give a thorough review of data representations in CSS for both text and network.
Specifically, we summarize existing representations into two schemes, namely symbol-based and embeddingbased representations, and introduce a series of typical methods for each scheme. Afterwards, we present the
applications of the above representations based on the investigation of more than 400 research articles from 6
top venues involved with CSS. From the statistics of these applications, we unearth the strength of each kind
of representations and discover the tendency that embedding-based representations are emerging and obtaining
increasing attention over the last decade. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and open issues for future
directions. This survey aims to provide a deeper understanding and more advisable applications of data
representations for CSS researchers."
