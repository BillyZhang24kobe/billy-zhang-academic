I am a master student majoring in Computer Science at Columbia University. My reseach interests center around Natural Language Processing, Social Computing and Dialogue Systems.

Currently, I am a research intern working with Prof. {{<staticref "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/">}} Zhou Yu {{< /staticref >}} on Dialogue Systems in the {{<staticref "http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi">}} NLP Lab at Columbia {{< /staticref >}}. Before that, I was a full-time research assistant in {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">}} THUNLP {{< /staticref >}} working with Prof. {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">}} Zhiyuan Liu {{< /staticref >}} on NLP applications in Computational Social Science. Even before that, I also worked with Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/">}} Vincent Ng {{< /staticref >}} on topics related to sentiment analysis and opinion mining, as a research assistant in {{<staticref "http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">}} HLTRI {{< /staticref >}} at UT Dallas. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Aritifical Intelligence from {{<staticref "https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">}} University of Nottingham Ningbo China {{< /staticref >}}, where I completed my first thesis project with Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">}} Zheng Lu {{< /staticref >}}. You can find my thesis {{< staticref "uploads/billyzhang_thesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
